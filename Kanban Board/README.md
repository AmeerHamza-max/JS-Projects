# Kanban Task Management Board

A clean, interactive **Kanban Task Management Board** built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, designed to practice and demonstrate real-world **frontend development fundamentals** such as DOM manipulation, state management, and drag-and-drop interactions.

This project was created as a **skill-revision and hands-on learning exercise**, focusing on building functionality without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
